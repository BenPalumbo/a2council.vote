Hello everyone, and welcome to a new site designed to expose Ann Arbor City Council agenda information and votes in a more user-friendly and accessible way. Started by a small group of civic-minded nerds, we were concerned that it was difficult to access reliable and unbiased information about the workings of council. All content on this site will be neutral and unaffiliated with any particular candidate or campaign, they will simply be a record of activity.

If you're interested in helping us to improve this site, or have any questions, please see the [about page]({{< ref "about" >}}).
